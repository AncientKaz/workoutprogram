# Workout Bot (Python)
By using PyCharm/VS Code to program this sequence, and Pushover for their API, I was able to create a code sequence that sends me my workouts every morning to my phone.

## Programs used
- PyCharm Community & VS Code: Used for coding the program
- AWS Lambda (WiP): To be used to run the code through cloud-based methods.
- Task Scheduler: The more local way of having the code run for me so that I don't need to run the code myself.
